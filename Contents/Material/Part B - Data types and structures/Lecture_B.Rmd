## Recap

We have learned the basics of programming in `R`:

- How to use `RStudio`, `R`-scripts and `Quarto`-documents
- How to assign numbers to variables (`<-`)
- Data types (elements)
  - character, numeric, integer, logical, factor
- Data structures: composed of data types
  - vector, matrix, list, data.frame
- Code is applied on those data types/structures to transform them 

## Quick detour: Naming conventions
- You can't have spaces in your variable names.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
student cleaned <- 3
```

- Some programming languages tell you how to handle this, but not R.
- I use `students_cleaned`. This is the standard of Python. Use any, but be consistent

```{r, eval = FALSE}
student_cleaned <- 3 #studentCleaned
```

# Data Types (Elements)

## Data Types
They are the basis of everything

### 1: Character
```{r}

var_char <- "ab"
class(var_char)
```

---

### 2: Numeric
```{r}
var_num <- 3.2
class(var_num)
```

```{r}
var_ind <- "3"
class(var_ind)

converted_var <- as.numeric(var_ind)
class(converted_var)
```

---

```{r}
var_inf <- Inf
class(var_inf)

var_nan <- NaN
class(var_nan)
```



---

### 3: Logical
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
var_true <- TRUE
class(var_true)
```

Behind the scenes they are numbers: FALSE = 0, TRUE = 1
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
as.numeric(var_true)
var_true + var_true
```

They arise when comparing elements
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
a <- 3
b <- 5
a == b

a == "3"

a == 3
```

# Data Structures: Objects that contain more than one element

---

### Basic data types (elements)
- `character`: "some text"
- `numeric`: e.g., 2.1
- `integer`: e.g., 2L
- `logical`: TRUE/FALSE
- `factor`: e.g., factor("amsterdam")

### Basic data structures 
- Consist of data types and functions to transform them
  - `vector`: c(2, 4, 2) 
  - `list`: list(first_col = 1, second = "a", third = TRUE)
  - `matrix`: matrix(c(4, 4, 4, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
  - `data.frame`: The most important ~ spreadsheet



## 1: Vector
- Collection of elements of the __same type__
- We concatenate the elements using the `c()` function (stands for concatenation)
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
#To create a vector we used `c()`, which stands for 'concatenation'. 
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
a <- 1:5
a
```

Characters (or character strings) in `R` are indicated by the double quote identifier. 
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
c(a, "A")
```

Repeating the same element many times
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
rep(a, 3)
```

## Retrieving elements from vectors by position
If we would want just the third element, we would type
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
#The first element in R is 1 (in other languages (e.g. Python) it is 0)
a[3]
```

## Retrieving elements from vectors by range
If we would want the first to the third (both included)
```{r}
#The first element in R is 1 (in other languages (e.g. Python) it is 0)
a[1:3]
```

Empty means all elements
```{r}
#(In Python is :)
a[]
```



## 2. Matrix: Multiple vectors in one object

```{r,collapse=TRUE}
matrix(3, nrow = 5, ncol = 2)
```

```{r,collapse=TRUE}
#We can also create them with vectors, it fills the matrix by column. But be careful!
c <- matrix(c(1,2,3), nrow = 5, ncol = 2)
c
```

## Retrieving elements in matrices
The first row is retrieved with
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
c[1, ]
```

The second column is retrieved with
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
c[, 2]
```

The intersection of the first row and second column is called by
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
c[1, 2]
```

We can also use ranges.
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
c[1:3, 2]
```


## Matrices with mixed numeric / character data
If we add a character column to matrix `c`; everything becomes a character:
```{r}
cbind(c, c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"))
```

Remember, matrices and vectors are numerical OR character objects. They can never contain both and still be used for numerical calculations. 

## 3. Data frames
Data frames can contain both numerical and character elements at the same time, although never in the same column. You can think of them as spreadsheets (with column names, and rows)

```{r}
d <- data.frame("V1" = rnorm(5),
                "V2" = rnorm(5, mean = 5, sd = 2), 
                "V3" = c("a","a","b","b","b"))
d
```

We 'filled' a dataframe with two randomly generated sets from the normal distribution - where $V1$ is standard normal and $V2 \sim N(5,2)$ - and a character set. 

## Data frames (continued)

You can name the columns and rows in data frames (just like in matrices)
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
#Rows
row.names(d) <- c("row 1", "row 2", "row 3", "row 4", "row 5")
d
```

```{r,collapse=TRUE}
#Columns
names(d) <- c("V1", "V2_new", "V3")
d
```


## Retrieving row elements in data frames
There are two ways to obtain row `3` from data frame `d`:
```{r}
d["row 3", ]
d[3, ]
```

CAREFUL! You always need the comma (,) when filtering by rows. Otherwise you filter by column!

## Retrieving columns elements in data frames
All
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
d$V2_new
d[["V2_new"]]
d[, "V2_new"] # Careful! In tibbles this returns a one-col tibble
d[, 2] # Careful! In tibbles this returns a one-col tibble
```
Using it without the comma returns a dataframe
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
d["V2_new"] # and d[2]

```

## Retrieving both

The intersection between row 2 and column 3 can be obtained by
```{r}
d[2, 3]
```

And you can also use ranges
```{r}
d[3:4, 1:2]
```


## 4. Factor
- A data type used to encode categorical variables
- It'll be useful for data modeling and data visualization
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
d$V3_factor <- factor(d$V3, labels = c("Amsterdam","Utrecht"))
d
```
Class
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
class(d$V3_factor)
```

Summary
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
str(d$V3_factor)
```


## Use of as.xxx functions
You can convert between data types (as long as the conversion is valid)
```{r}
d$V2_int <- as.integer(d$V2_new)
d
```

```{r}
d$V2_char <- as.character(d$V2_int)
d
```

## 5. List: Mixed type
You can have a list of everything mixed with everything. 
For example, an simple list can be created by
```{r}
a <- 1:5 #a vector
f <- list(a) #convert to a list
f
```

Elements or objects within lists can be called by using double square brackets [[]]. For example, the first (and only) element in list `f` is object `a`
```{r}
f[[1]]
```

## Lists (continued)
We can simply add an object or element to an existing list
```{r}
f[[2]] <- d
f
```
to obtain a list with a vector and a data frame. 

## Lists (continued)
We can add names to the list as follows
```{r}
names(f) <- c("vector", "data frame")
f
```

## Lists (continued)
We can also create it as 
```{r}
f <- list("vector" = 1:5, 
          "data frame" = f)
f
```

## Retrieving elements in lists
Retrieving the vector from the list can be done as follows
```{r}
f[[1]]
f[["vector"]]
f$vector
```

## Lists in lists
```{r}
g <- list(1:4, list("vector" = 5:1,
                    "matrix_ex" = matrix(0, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)))
g
```


To call the vector from the second list within the list g, use the following code
```{r}
g[[2]][[1]] #Also g[[2]]$vector

```

# Filtering by condition

## Logical operators
- Logical operators are signs that evaluate a statement, such as `==` (equal),  `!=` (different), `<` (lower), `>` (greater), `<=` (lower or equal), `>=` (greater or equal), and `|` (OR) as well as `&` (AND). 

- For example, if we would like elements out of example vector below that are larger than 3, we would type:
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
example_vector <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
example_vector[example_vector>3]

```

#### Why does this work?
It filters the vector, keeping the elements where the condition is TRUE
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
example_vector > 3
```


## Logical operators (cont'd)
If we would like the elements that are smaller than 3 OR larger than 3, we could type.
```{r}
example_vector[(example_vector < 3) | (example_vector > 3)] #c smaller than 3 or larger than 3
```
or
```{r}
example_vector[example_vector != 3] #c not equal to 3
```


## Logical operators (cont'd)
You can use `%in` to select specific elements
```{r}
example_vector %in% c(1,5)
example_vector[example_vector %in% c(1,5)]
```


Typing `!` before a logical operator takes the complement of that action (the opposite) 
```{r}
!(example_vector %in% c(1,5))
```


## Logical operators (cont'd)
They are extremely useful in dataframes

```{r,collapse=TRUE}
d
```

```{r}
d$V1 > 0
d[d$V1 > 0, ]

```

# Functions

## Basic idea
- Take some standard input (e.g. a vector of numbers)
- Return some standard output (e.g. the mean)
- You call them with parenthesis
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```

- You can save the output with a name
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
mean_v <- mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
mean_v
```


- When they come from a package, you can call them in two ways
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
#You can specify the package where the library comes from
dplyr::n_distinct(c(1,2,2,3,3))
```


## Function's arguments
- Functions typically have arguments (i.e., things that the function need to work). 
- Usually at least one is required. e.g., in the mean example you need to pass a vector of numbers.
- Other arguments tell the function how it should handle the input. In the example below it tells the mean function to remove missing values.
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5,NA))
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5,NA), na.rm = TRUE)
```


- You can create your own (more on this later)
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
my_mean <- function(vector_num){
  return(sum(vector_num)/length(vector_num))
}

my_mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```



# Math errors

## Things that cannot be done
- Things that have no representation in real number space
    - For example, the following code returns "Not a Number"
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
0 / 0
```

- Also impossible are calculations based on missing values (NA's)
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
mean(c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5))
```

- You can ignore missing values (often not recommended). Two ways:
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
mean(c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5), na.rm = TRUE)
mean(na.omit(c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)))
```

## Be careful with rounding errors
- The computer uses approximations of the numbers (floating-point arithmetic). This can create problems in R:
```{r,collapse=TRUE}
(3 - 2.9)
(3 - 2.9) == 0.1
(3 - 2.9) - 0.1

```

You can use the function near from the library dplyr
```{r}
#install.packages("dplyr")
#library(dplyr) #we already run this earlier, we don't need it again
dplyr::near((3 - 2.9), 0.1)
```

# Applications
## Reading a CSV file and descriptive statistics
That was dry, but let's see some potential, reading a CSV file and calculating some descriptive statistics.

You'll need to install the packages/load the library beforehand
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
#install.packages(c("readr","readxl","haven","foreign","Hmisc"),
#repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

readr::read_delim("here_path.csv", delim = ",") #CSV
readr::read_rds("here_path.Rds") #RDS (R format)
readxl::read_excel("here_path.xlsx") #Excel
haven::read_dta("here_path.dta") #Stata
haven::read_spss("here_path.sav") #SPSS
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
#Read example data
df <- readr::read_delim("../common_datasets/dataset_boys.csv", delim = ",")
```


## Calculate some descriptive statistics

```{r}
#Give some information
str(df)
```

---

```{r}
summary(df)
```

---

```{r}
library(Hmisc)
Hmisc::describe(df)
```

## Some programming tips:
- __Keep your code clean__
  - Break the code in components, keep it tidy
  - Use (at least) a folder for the data, and another for figures; don't save all code in one folder.
  - If you have several R files, use descriptive names (e.g. 1_data_collection.Rmd; 2_data_cleaning.Rmd; etc)
  - Write all code in the source editor, don't use the console until you know what you are doing. Otherwise you'll forget to copy a step to the code and you'll not be able to remember what you did.

- Use __comments__ (text preceded by `#`) to clarify what you are doing
  - If you look at your code again, one year from now: you will not know what you did --> unless you use comments 


## Useful shortcuts
- `Tab` while typing in the console: list all objects with that name
- `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd+Enter` (Mac): run line or selection
- `Ctrl+Alt+I` (Windows) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac): insert R chunk


# Practical

## How to approach the next practical
Aim to make the exercises without looking at the answers. 

- Use the answers to evaluate your work
- Use the help to identify how functions work

If this does not work out --> show the code.

In any case; ask for help when you feel help is needed.

- Do not 'struggle' for too long: we only have limited time!
