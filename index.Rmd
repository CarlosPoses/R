# Quick Overview

## Column 1

### Outline
R is rapidly becoming the standard platform for data manipulation, visualization and analysis and has a number of advantages over other statistical software packages. A wide community of users contribute to R, resulting in an enormous coverage of statistical procedures, including many that are not available in any other statistical program. Furthermore, it is highly flexible for programming and scripting purposes, for example when manipulating data or creating professional plots. However, R lacks standard GUI menus, as in SPSS for example, from which to choose what statistical test to perform or which graph to create. As a consequence, R is more challenging to master. Therefore, this course offers an elaborate introduction into statistical programming in R. Students learn to operate R, make plots, fit, assess and interpret a variety of basic statistical models and do advanced statistical programming and data manipulation. The topics in this course include regression models for linear, dichotomous, ordinal and multivariate data, statistical inference, statistical learning, bootstrapping and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. 

Materials covered:

##### Day 1:
- Installing R/Rstudio or signing up for RStudio Cloud (done at home) 
- Getting comfortable with notebooks/projects/scripts
- Getting help
- Variables in R: basic data types (character, numeric, integer, logical, date) and data structures (vectors, matrices, lists, data.frames)
- Filtering using logical operator
- Type conversion (as.integer/as.numeric/as.factor)
- Understanding/installing packages
- Reading a CSV and calculating descriptive statistics

##### Day 2:
- Control flow (if-else statements and for loops)
- Functions: creating your own functions
- Principles of tidy data and short comparison of base R and the tidyverse
- Reading and writing files in several formats
- Inferential statistics: A 5-min primer of linear regression
- Best practices in R

# How to prepare

## Column 1

### **Option 1: Without administrator rights or the ability to install `R/RStudio`**

Steps: please sign up for [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). Choose the free plan.


## Column 2

### **Option 2: Installing `R` and `RStudio` from scratch**

Steps: 

- 1. Install `R`: `R` can be obtained [here](https://cran.r-project.org). We won't use `R` directly in the course, but rather call `R` through `RStudio`. Therefore it needs to be installed. 

- 2. Install `RStudio` Desktop: Rstudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It can be obtained as stand-alone software [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). The free and open source `RStudio Desktop` version is sufficient.


## Column 3

### **Option 3: You have an old version of R**

Steps: see [this manual](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/3-methods-update-r-rstudio-windows-mac-woratana-ngarmtrakulchol/). 

- To update `R`: The function `updateR()` in the package `installR` (Windows) or `updateR` (Mac) is the easiest route.
- To update `RStudio` Desktop: Download the new version [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
